# Udacity AI Nanodegree final project

This project is my submission for the Udacity Graduate AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. Using transfer learning, I have implemented two pretrained networks - ResNet and VGG - as options for data flow into neural networks to predict the name of various flowers.
